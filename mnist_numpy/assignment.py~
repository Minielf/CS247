        This model class provides the data structures for your NN, 
        and has functions to test the three main aspects of the training.
        The data structures should not change after each step of training.
        You can add to the class, but do not change the 
        stencil provided except for the blanks and pass statements.
        Make sure that these functions work with a loop to call them multiple times,
        instead of implementing training over multiple steps in the function
